# Star Scattering Prom Projector by Matthew Evan

This project was made for the prom night at our school. It will display scattered stars, preferably displayed on a wall from a projector.

There are two modes: ``Main`` and ``Secondary``. ``Main`` will display stars and "Prom 2021", while ``Secondary`` will display only stars.

## How to deploy

Most people should be able to view the page with the Github Page. If you are in a situation where you have no internet you can clone the git repo, download the zipped folder and extract it, or download every file and open ``index.html`` on any computer with a web browser, select your mode (Main or Secondary) then maximize the window with the F11 key on the projector screen.
