# Star Scattering Prom Projector by Matthew Evan

This project was made for the prom night at our school. It will scatter stars on the wall from a projector.

## How to deploy

Clone the git repo, download the zipped folder and extract it, or download the ``main.html``, ``main.css``, ``star.png`` files and open them on any computer with a web browser, then maximize the window with the F11 key on the projector.
